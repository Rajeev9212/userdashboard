Usage
Once the app is running, navigate to the “Users” page (or whatever route you have).

You can add a new user by filling out the form.

You can edit existing users or delete them.

Filter or search the user list (if implemented) to quickly find entries.

(Optional) Hook it up to a backend API by replacing the mock data logic with real HTTP requests.
